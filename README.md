## Dependencies

This repo assumes it is the root lua folder.

The lua files in this repo rely on a few files from the base macroquest lua project.  Ensure these files also live in the root lua folder.
* `integration-tests\mqTest.lua` - Download from official location: https://github.com/macroquest/integration-tests
* `mq\PackageMan.lua` - This should be generated by compiling the official MacroQuest solution: https://github.com/macroquest/macroquest

## Notice about borrowed code

Any borrowed files try to credit original authors within the file's object block, which looks like:

    local SomeThing = {
        authors = "originalAuthor, secondaryAuthor"
    }

If you find uncredited code, please bring it to my attention and I will cite contributing authors.
